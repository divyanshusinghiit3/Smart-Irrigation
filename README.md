# Smart-Irrigation  
The Smart Irrigation System is an IoT solution that resolves the issue of water wastage and inefficient irrigation in agricultural practices. Conventional approaches tend to waste enormous
quantities of water with the help of manual operation and insensitivities to the requirements of crops. In this project, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors are used along with 
an ESP8266/Arduino microcontroller to automate the process of irrigation based on real-time field conditions. When soil moisture is below a predetermined threshold, the system will open a water
pump or valve and irrigate up to the desired level. Data communication is via Wi-Fi or GSM modules so that farmers can monitor and control the system from a mobile device or cloud platform.

By providing water only where needed, the system optimizes resource usage, saves on costs, and maximizes crop yield. The system is flexible, automated, and convenient, and enables sustainable agriculture.
In the future, the project can be upgraded with AI-driven predictive models, weather forecasting, and intelligent fertigation methods to supply both water and nutrients optimally. 
This positions the Smart Irrigation System as a scalable, environmentally friendly, and future-proof solution for future agriculture.
